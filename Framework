# Fake News Detection System Using Deep Learning and Web Technologies

## 1. Project Title
**Fake News Detection System Using Deep Learning and Web Technologies**

---

## 2. Problem Statement
The rapid dissemination of fake news on digital platforms poses serious societal challenges. While many existing solutions remain confined to research environments, there is a lack of deployed, user-accessible systems. This project aims to develop a real-world, web-based fake news detection system using deep learning techniques.

---

## 3. Objectives
- Build an automated fake news detection model using deep learning.
- Develop a React-based frontend for user interaction.
- Create a Node.js + Express backend to manage requests.
- Integrate a Python-based machine learning inference service.
- Deploy the system on cloud infrastructure.
- Design the system to be extensible for future bias detection.

---

## 4. Scope of the Project

### Included
- Text-based fake news detection (Fake / Real)
- Manual text input
- Web-based application
- English language news articles

---

## 5. System Architecture Overview

### Workflow
1. User enters news text in the React UI  
2. React sends a request to the Node.js + Express API  
3. Backend forwards the text to the ML inference service  
4. Deep learning model predicts Fake or Real  
5. Result is returned and displayed to the user

- JSON-based input and output  

---

### 7.6 Backend Implementation
- REST API endpoint: `/analyze-news`  
- Handles input validation and error handling  
- Communicates with the ML inference service  

---

### 7.7 Frontend Implementation

#### Features
